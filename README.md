# prose-test
For editors to try using the webapp Prose.io to edit markdown files directly in the browser.

Steps:

Please take notes and send me details and correction to help people with this process. Especially people who are not technically inclined.

1. Have a GiHhub account. Emails can be provided to commited members.
2. Join the Org & the team:
   
   1. Join Organization `globasa-team` by providing your info.
   2. Join the [test team](https://github.com/orgs/Globasa-Team/teams/test). Is there a button to click to request it? Or do you need to be added by admin?
  
4. Setup the [Prose.io](https://prose.io) website/webapp, which allows you to edit GitHub files directly from your web browser:
   
    1. Connect your GitHub account.
    2. Allow Prose access to the Globasa Team Organization. (Does it allow access just to some repo/repositories?)
   
5. Edit the test repo on GitHub

    1. You may need to switch from your personal repos to the Globasa Team organization.
    2. Choose the `prose-test` repo (or repository).
    3. Create a file or edit a test file. Do not edit `README.md` or `LICENSE`.
    4. Click the save icon ("Changes to save") on the far right.
    5. Give a commit message about the changes, like 'fixed typo', 'added joke', 'updated content', 'testing'.
    6. Click the commit button.

People who know Git will realize that this is a direct edit to the repo, rather than a change request for review. People with direct access will be vetted before hands. (And their changes can always be rolled back.)

Edit: there seems to be an issue with tabs in prose.

Also: it might be about as easy to add a repo to https://vscode.dev and we should test that and make instructions.
