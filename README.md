# prose-test
For editors to try using prose.

Steps:

Please take notes and send me details and correction to help people with this process. Especially people who are not technically inclined.

1. Have a GiHhub account. Emails can be provided to commited members.
2. Join the [test team](https://github.com/orgs/Globasa-Team/teams/test).
3. Setup [Prose.io](https://prose.io):
    a. Connect your GitHub account.
    b. Allow Prose access to the Globasa Team Organization. (Does it allow access just to some repo/repositories?)
4. Edit the test repo on GitHub
    a. You may need to switch from your personal repos to the Globasa Team organization.
    b. Choose the `prose-test` repo (or repository).
    c. Create a file or edit a test file. Do not edit `README.md` or `LICENSE`.
    d. Click the save icon ("Changes to save") on the far right.
    e. Give a commit message about the changes, like 'fixed typo', 'added joke', 'updated content', 'testing'.
    f. Click the commit button.

People who know Git will realize that this is a direct edit to the repo, rather than a change request for review. People with direct access will be vetted before hands. (And their changes can always be rolled back.)
